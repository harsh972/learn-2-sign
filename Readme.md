# Learn2Sign

Being able to recognize sign language is an interesting computer vision problem while simultaneously being extremely useful for deaf people to interact with people who donâ€™t know how to understand American Sign Language (ASL).

## What it does ðŸ¤–
We created this application to help people better communicate with the deaf so that they can express themselves, this application uses a image classifier from teachable machines, which is a Google API. It detect user's hand gestures and show the corresponding english alphabets (basically it converts ASL to english language).

## Challenges we ran into-
- Creating a model with good acccuracy in a general setting.
- Reverse engineering the Teachable Machine's Web Plugin snippet to aggregate data and then display the characters accordingly.
- Integrating the model into our website.
- Deploying the application.
